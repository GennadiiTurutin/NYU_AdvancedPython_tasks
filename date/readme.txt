Assignment description by David Blaikie: 
date_simple.py contains functions for working with dates. 
The motivation for the module is to simplify the interface to Python's datetime module 
(which is simply designed, but still requires studying and remembering specialized syntax). 
Since date_simple merely provides an alternate interface to an existing module.


Here is a detailed description of each function, that we have to produce:

get_date_object():  this function can be called either with no argument 
		in which case it should return the date object for today 
		or a 'date' value, in which case it should return a date object for that date.

get_date_string():  this function can be called either with no argument	
		in which it should return the string date for today 
		or a date object, in which case it should return the string date for that object's date.
